# DES-Algorithm

### Introduction

DES is a block encryption algorithm with symmetric keys. It is called "symmetric key" because the keys used for encryption and decryption are the same. DES functions by outputting a 64-bit ciphertext, given a 64-bit plaintext and a 64-bit key. This ciphertext can be decrypted with the same key. The so-called "64-bit key" actually contains only 56 bits. The remaining bits can be discarded or used as parity bits.

### Functionalities:

- Encryption and Decryption are independently constructed based on DES Algorithm;
- The length of the plain/cipher text or the key is not restricted;
- A decent and user-friendly interface is implemented;
- The plain text can be entered by either file selecting or text input.
